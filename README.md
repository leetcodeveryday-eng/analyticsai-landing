## Customization

### Styling
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the design by modifying:
- `tailwind.config.js` - Theme configuration
- `src/index.css` - Custom CSS classes
- Component-specific styles in each component

### AI Responses
Currently, the AI assistant uses simulated responses. To integrate with a real AI service:
1. Replace the simulated responses in `App.tsx`
2. Add API calls to your preferred AI service
3. Handle loading states and error cases

### File Processing
The current implementation simulates IPA file analysis. To add real IPA processing:
1. Implement IPA file parsing logic
2. Extract real bundle information
3. Add more detailed app structure analysis
